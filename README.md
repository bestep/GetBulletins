# GetBulletins

## What is it?
A simple python script to pull a series of files using curl

## Installation

The script was written for Python 3, and requires the [pycurl](http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/) library.  

Please note, you must be a member of the [Seven Seas Cruising Association (SSCA)](http://www.ssca.org/) to access the bulletins. However, the mechanics of the script for pulling files with consistent file naming conventions may be useful to non-members.
